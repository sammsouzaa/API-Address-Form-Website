# API Address Form Website

Welcome to the API Address Form Website repository! This project, developed as part of the "Programação para Internet" (Web Programming) course, is a web application that features a form allowing users to enter their information. An API call is used to dynamically fill in address details when the user enters a zip code (CEP).

## Features
- Form with fields for user information including zip code.
- Integration with a CEP API for automatic filling of address details.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.

## Code Overview
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript code makes an asynchronous request to a CEP API when the user enters a zip code, dynamically populating the address fields with the retrieved information.
